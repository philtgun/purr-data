# This is a GNU Makefile. Special tools needed: GNU make and awk, git.

# Make Debian packages. This builds a package from the current HEAD in a
# subdirectory named $(debdist). It also creates the source archive that goes
# along with it. All files will be created in the debuild directory.

# To make this work, you need to have the Debian package toolchain (debuild
# and friends) installed. You should also set the DEBEMAIL environment (or
# make) variable to your full name and email address as explained in the
# debchange(1) manual page, e.g.: DEBEMAIL="John Doe <johndoe@mail.com>"
# This information is used to create changelog entries with 'make debchange',
# which in turn are used to sign the Debian packages created with 'make deb'
# and 'make debsrc'. (Otherwise some generic information supplied by the
# system will be used, and you may not be able to sign the package.)

# The typical workflow is as follows:

# 1. Run 'make debchange' once to create a new debian/changelog entry. You
# *must* do this once after changes in the source repository so that debuild
# knows about the proper version number of the package.

# 2. Run 'make deb' to build a signed binary package. Or 'make deb-us' for an
# unsigned one.

# If you only need the binary package for local deployment then you're done.
# Otherwise proceed to step 3.

# 3. Run 'make debsrc' to create a signed Debian source package which can be
# uploaded, e.g, to Launchpad using 'dput'. Or 'make debsrc-us' for an
# unsigned package.

# 4. Run 'make debclean' to get rid of any files that were created in steps 2
# and 3.

# The Debian version gets derived from the date and serial number of the last
# commit. You can print it with 'make debversion'.
